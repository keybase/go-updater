**Warning**: This isn't ready for non-Keybase libraries to use yet!

The goals of this library are to provide an updater that:

- Is simple
- Works on all our platforms (at least OS X, Windows, Linux)
- Recovers from non-fatal errors
- Can recover from failures in its environment
- Can run as an unpriviledged background service
- Has minimal, vendored dependencies
- Is well tested
- Is secure
- Reports failures and activity
- Can notify the user of any non-transient failures

This updater library is used to support updating (in background and on-demand)
for Keybase apps and services.


### Development

Install the pre-commit hook (and run manually):

```
pip install pre-commit
go get -u github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter
gometalinter --install --update
pre-commit install
pre-commit run -a
```
